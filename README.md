# 3D-Binpacking-with-product-family
Optimizing load balanced 3D-Binpacking with product family: Multiobjective Genetic Algorithm

First line: dimensions of bin

Second line: total number of product family

The third line and subsequent lines consist of the number of products, product dimensions, weight, and product family, in that order.
